# ExpensesTracker
This app allows you to track your expenses by adding daily operations to local storage and then review monthly or daily reports. Monthly report group expenses by items names, so you can see general sum of expenses, for example, for Food item. Also, you can edit list of your operations by removing daily expenses items.
